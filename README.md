# Research-Project-Database

## ðŸ“š Research Projects Database - NIAT 

This project implements a relational database for managing research projects, employees, and funding agencies using SQL. The schema is based on a real-world academic or corporate research setting where:

- Projects are funded by agencies.
- Employees can work on multiple projects.
- Each project is managed by a single employee (who is also an employee).
- Funding agencies support multiple projects.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Key Features

- **Employee Management**: Tracks employees using their SSN, name, and salary.
- **Project Management**: Each project has a unique ID, name, duration, and budget.
- **Funding Agencies**: Stores agency details including name and address.
- **Project Assignment**: Tracks which employees are assigned to which projects, along with their respective project managers.
- **Manager Tracking**: Separately maintains the manager assigned to each project.
